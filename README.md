# monitor_vaccin_appointment

In France, the only way to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is to make a digital appointment on https://www.doctolib.fr/. As I’m sure most of us can relate, my grandmother who is 94 years old missed the digital revolution and finds it impossible to navigate technology in today’s modern era. I wanted to help her and make this appointment for her. Unfortunately, it's very difficult to find available slot. That's the reason why I built a bot which check for me every 30 minutes if a new appointment is available.
